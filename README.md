# Miiunii

## What is this?

This is a social networking system inspired by Nintendo's Miiverse and made on Django and Python.

## Who is doing this?

For now I'm doing this alone, but you can collaborate!

## Why?

because i want to do it and i want to be more creative on my own miiverse clone.

## When is it going to be ready?

Not now, but hopefully soon.

## What features are you going to add?

Now that's a good question! I'll answer it for you.

- A plugin engine (add some perks to your users)
- A theme engine (with a theme switcher for users)
- Chatrooms
- DMs
- Real time counters
- Word filters
- An integrated image manipulation tool
- Image autoloading
- Advanced drawing
- User-made communities

And of course

- The basic functionality of Miiverse

I'll add more features soon, but for now that's all I got.
